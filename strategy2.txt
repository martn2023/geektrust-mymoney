After 1 day of coding, I received these criticisms:

1. The Portfolio class is doing too much. Solutions include
    A) making a new class to handle Rebalancing
        which the Controller will trigger upon "rebalance" commands
        Rebalancer will call a Portfolio function to retrieve assets
        do some calculations
        will feed those calculations into a changevalue function of the AssetClass object to promote encapsulation

        have it store that as a field
        create a function for returning the last field stored OR printing an error message if field is empty

    B) skipping the Portfolio alltoggether and triggering SIP's new function for inducing monthly inflows

2. nesting loop logic should be reduced
